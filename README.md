#  Server Home Lab  <br><br>Dell PowerEdge R710 Server Setup

This repository documents the setup, configuration, and maintenance of my personal home lab using a **Dell PowerEdge R710** server. It runs a virtualized environment for testing and learning enterprise-level IT infrastructure.




---

##  Goals of the Lab

- Gain hands-on experience with enterprise hardware/software.
- Practice virtualization, network services, and OS configuration.
- Develop system administration and troubleshooting skills.

---

##  Server Overview

- **Server Model**: Dell PowerEdge R710
- **Hypervisor**: Proxmox VE (Virtual Environment)
- **Purpose**: Virtualization, network testing, remote management, system updates, and containerization.
